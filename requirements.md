# Requirements Document: TrustScan AI

## Introduction

TrustScan AI is a Product Transparency & Lifecycle Intelligence Platform designed to solve critical information asymmetry problems in retail markets. The system addresses three interconnected pain points: customers cannot verify product authenticity and quality, store owners cannot verify supplier stock integrity, and products near expiry are wasted or sold deceptively. The platform provides instant product verification through QR code scanning, AI-powered tampering detection, and intelligent inventory management for both B2C (customer-facing) and B2B (store owner) use cases.

The solution targets the Indian retail market initially while maintaining global scalability, leveraging AWS services (Bedrock, Rekognition, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway) to deliver measurable impact in reducing counterfeit purchases, minimizing product waste, and increasing customer trust.
